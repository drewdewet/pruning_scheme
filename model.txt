score canes individually - brute force best combo

GBDT to score or classify resultant vine struture ( may have to classify as 1 or 0 if only have annotations of 1 chosen scheme)
Fetures:
for each sides bearer:
    diameter, orientation feats, length, position feats, internode length, node count
original cane count of plant
spur features if spurring
relative position and orientation of bearers



CURRENT TRY:
GBDT to select a bearer seperately on each side, can use rules to get best candidates first to even class distributions slightly
Features for that cane


Code:
    - Cane feature extractor
    - Candidates finder, given a vine score the best n on a side
    - Dataset generator, for each vine for each side add selected cane and its features and n-1 unselected and their features
    - model, GBDT model or simlar to predict if branch selected
    - label plant, puts candidates for each side into model and finds most strogly classified cane

Pitfall - a cane selected on one vine may not be on another, model needs to know what the other options were
possible solution - normalise features among canes on side of vine first
possible solution - add features for rank among candidates for different metrics or overall heuristic score, maybe just for certain features
possible solution - if selected always in top 5 or so canes could stack all candidates into model in order and classify between 5 classes
